# Changelog

## 0.6.1 + 0.6.2

- Remove `variable-name` rule. Get's too much in the way when writing jsx.

## 0.6.0

Add code-style rules. Unfortunately `TSLint` is not as feature
rich as `ESLint` in this regard.

## 0.5.0

This is a pre-release. Everything seems to be working so far
and we'll slowly roll this preset out to more projects.
